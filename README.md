# 27-2-hierarchy-geometric-shapes

Design a class hierarchy of different shapes: circle, square, equilateral triangle, rectangle.
For all these figures there are common data fields - these are the coordinates of their center and the conditional color of the figure: red, blue or green.
For individual shapes, there are also unique parameters: radius for a circle, edge length for a square and an equilateral triangle, width and height for a rectangle.
All data is real numbers with double precision.
For each of the figures, it is required to determine the method for finding the area of the figure, as well as the method for finding a rectangle that describes the figure completely (it can be larger than the area of the figure, but not less).
